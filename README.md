## Introduction
This is a marketing analysis on the [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/) dataset named [Marketing Analysis](https://www.kaggle.com/jackdaoud/marketing-data) using [Tableu Public](https://public.tableau.com/en-us/s/).
## The Analysis
### Introduction
Overall trends says that even though number of customer interactions have remained about constant per week, the number of purchases have declined. 

We can also see a steady decline in all methods of purchase with web purchases declining the steepest.

Let's try to see where can we improve.

## Country-wise Numbers

We see that most of the customers and purchases are from Singapore least being from Montenegro. The company is probably based in Singapore (not given). Perhaps regionalized marketing strategies targeted for the top 3 countries.

## Income Statistics

The graph shows distribution of average income by Age and Country.

Looking at Income by Country we see every country has median income close to $50,000 with USA being the highest with $55,000.

Looking at Income by Age we see something interesting. The individuals who are of 25-30 years of age have median income of $71,000. Then it roughly increases in an expected fashion from the age group of 30-35 years to 75-80 years from $39,000 to $72,000. Depending on the nature of the business keeping young and wealthy individuals happy could be beneficial. Otherwise marketing for income range of $36,000 - $56,000 would be ideal.

## Sales Statistics

We can see that most of the purchases are in-store followed by web purchases. Deals could be marketed more to increase revenue depending on the type of business.

Wine is the most bought product followed by Meat.

Singapore has the most web visits followed by Saudi Arabia and Canada. Most of the web purchases are also from these regions which makes sense. India and Germany follow the same trend.
